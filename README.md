# CCR5 within Cells
A Pipeline to analyze CCR5 staining (or any other dot like staining) within microglia or neuronal somata.
Please find the source code as well as an example and a manual above.

## Example microglia and somata thresholding

_Original image on the left panel. Scale bar: 20 Âµm. Upper panel shows thresholding for microglia data and lower one for somata data. Middle panel shows thresholding of the respective cell. Right panel shows thresholding of the CCR5 staining._

## Example image improvement and thresholding of the CCR5 staining

_Gaussian blur filtered image was substracted from unsharp mask filtered image to improve image qualtiy. Triangle dark was used to crate a binary mask._
